# City Generator: A Web-Based City Map Generator
A simple web-based application that generates a random city map based on the selected style.

Please Note that the generator in its currnent form is at a basic level and cannot yet generate complex maps.

## Map Key

Each color on the map represents a different type of terrain:

- Grassland: Green
- Forest: Dark green
- Hills: Light brown
- Mountains: Dark brown
- River: Blue
- Lake: Light blue
- Sea: Dark blue

## Zoom

The zoom level is not fixed and depends on the size of the generated map. You can adjust the zoom level using the browser's zoom functionality. For example, in most web browsers, you can press `Ctrl + 0` to reset the zoom level to 100%. You can then zoom in or out by pressing `Ctrl +` or `Ctrl -`, respectively.

## Saving the Map

To save the generated map as an image file, you can right-click on the map in the web browser and select "Save image as..." or a similar option, depending on your browser. Alternatively, you can use the "Download as image" functionality provided by the application. To do this, right-click on the map, select "Inspect element" or "Inspect", and then find the "Download as image" button in the developer tools panel. Clicking this button will download the map as an image file.

Note: The "Download as image" button will only be shown if you click on the map, because it only becomes visible when you interact with the map.

## Planned additions
these are some of the additions i plan to add in the future

-More complex map and city generation logic
-More complex road layout logic
-Logic that applies real world city design and town planning to the map generation
-An intergarted height map for building heights
-More generation styles and types.
-More detailed maps
